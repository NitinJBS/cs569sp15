# Was the program correct or buggy?
I chose stack implementation program as my base code, this program defines a stack to hold characters. 
The harness that I wrote for this program, checks whether the program is 
doing well for the following conditions:
1) if the stack is empty, it does not allow pop.
2)if the stack is full, it does not allow push.

The stack implementation code was correct, and cbmc found it correct by using the mentioned harness.

#What was hard to specify?  Was there functionality you could not specify?
I could not specify whethet the for loop in the display function works well or not.

#CBMC Runtime Result
When the verificatin is successful, for DSIZE = 2  and unwind = 4, with bounds check and pointer check, the
CBMC runtime is about 0.06 seconds (and it checks 37805 variables, 47823 clauses). For the same parameters but without bounds check and
pointer check the verification took  0.031 seconds (and it checks 28018 variables, 19103 clauses).

When the verificatin is successful,for DSIZE = 3 and unwind = 6, with bounds check and pointer check, the
CBMC runtime is about 0.123 seconds (it checks 67505 variables, 69262 clauses). For the same parameters but without bounds check and
pointer check the verification took approximately 0.09 seconds (it checks 53083 variables, 28107 clauses).

When the verificatin is successful,for DSIZE = 4 and unwind = 8, with bounds check and pointer check, the
CBMC runtime is about 0.216s seconds (it checks 111759 variables, 90511 clauses). For the same parameters but without bounds check and
pointer check the verification took approximately 0.142 seconds ( it checks 92564 variables, 37083 clauses).
