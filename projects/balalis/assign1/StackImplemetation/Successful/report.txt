# Was the program correct or buggy?
I chose stack implementation program as my base code, this program defines a stack to hold characters. 
The harness that I wrote for this program, checks whether the program is 
doing well for the following conditions:
1) if the stack is empty, it does not allow pop.
2)if the stack is full, it does not allow push.

The stack implementation code was correct, and cbmc found it correct by using the mentioned harness.

#What was hard to specify?  Was there functionality you could not specify?

#CBMC Runtime Result

# The ability of the harness to find the bugs you introduced
